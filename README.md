# Maze-Master

📖 About The Project
The Problem: Traditional maze games often suffer from static gameplay and a lack of urgency, allowing players to solve puzzles without any real risk or pressure.

The Solution: This project transforms the traditional static maze into a dynamic survival challenge by introducing a continuous rising water mechanic. This forces players to make split-second pathfinding decisions, adding necessary urgency and replayability to the genre.

🎮 Key Features
Dynamic Rising Water: The core mechanic of the game. Water levels rise continuously, turning safe paths into dead ends.

High-Stakes Pathfinding: Players must calculate optimal routes in real-time under pressure.

Custom C++ Engine: Logic and memory management built from scratch for performance.

Raylib Rendering: Efficient 2D graphics utilizing Raylib for smooth frame rates.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: C++ (Chosen for high-performance logic handling and precise memory management).

Library: Raylib (Utilized for efficient 2D rendering and window management).
